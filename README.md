#IPC Debugger

Project Overview

The IPC Debugger is designed to monitor inter-process communication (IPC) by tracking messages exchanged between processes. It provides a debugging interface for user interaction and visualizes the communication flow. The system integrates three core modules:

IPC Monitoring: Tracks message exchanges between processes.

Debugging Interface: A command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.

Data Visualization: Displays the communication flow.

Module-Wise Breakdown

1. IPC Monitoring

Monitors IPC between processes using multiprocessing.Queue.

Implements sender and receiver processes for message exchange.

Provides real-time tracking of IPC messages.

2. Debugging Interface

Implements a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.

Allows starting, stopping, and checking the status of IPC debugging.

Facilitates controlled debugging operations.

3. Data Visualization

Displays message flow between sender and receiver.

Implements a text-based visualization of IPC message exchange.

Can be extended for graphical representations.

Functionalities

Real-time monitoring of IPC messages.

CLI for debugging control (start, stop, status check).

Visualization of message exchange.

Integration of all modules into a unified system.

Technology Used

Programming Languages:

Python

Libraries and Tools:

multiprocessing (for IPC handling)


time and random (for simulation purposes)

Matplotlib (for optional graphical visualization)

Other Tools:

GitHub (for version control and collaboration)

git clone (https://github.com/Giri0204/ipc_debugger.git)
cd ipc_debugger
2. Run the IPC Debugger
python main.py


Conclusion and Future Scope

Conclusion:

The IPC Debugger provides a structured approach to debugging inter-process communication by enabling monitoring, control, and visualization of message exchanges between processes.

Future Scope:

Enhance visualization using Matplotlib or Plotly.

Implement real-time graphical dashboards.

Expand debugging functionalities with logging and error handling.
